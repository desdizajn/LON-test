You must thoroughly verify, for every functionality, that all required components exist and are correctly implemented. This includes, but is not limited to:

- A corresponding backend service or business logic
- A properly implemented API endpoint (if applicable)
- A fully functional UI page or screen
- All required buttons, labels, inputs, and UI elements
- Correctly assigned actions, event handlers, and workflows for every button and control
- Any additional dependencies required for the module, feature, or functionality to work end-to-end

After verification, you must design and implement a solution that is complete, robust, and permanent.
Temporary solutions, workarounds, partial implementations, or “quick fixes” are not acceptable.

Once implementation is complete, you must:
- Test the entire functionality locally
- Verify that all features work as intended
- Ensure that the application builds successfully without errors

Only after you confirm that everything has been fully implemented and tested, I will:
- Commit the changes to GitHub
- Verify the solution locally on my environment
